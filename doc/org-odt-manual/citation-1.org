"If you have a large number of citations in your document, it's best
to use an external bibliographic application, such as =bibtex= or
=biber=. However, that is beyond the scope of this book.  See,
instead, /A Guide to LaTeX/ \cite{kopka95}, /The LaTeX Companion/
\cite{goossens94} or [[http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/thesis/][Using LaTeX to Write a PhD Thesis]]
[cite:@thesis]."
